Github repository of the project: "Bayesian modeling and clustering for spatio-temporal areal data: An application to Italian Fertility Rate".
This is a group project of the Bayesian Statistics course held in the year 2022-2023 at the Politecnico di Milano for the master degree in Mathematical Engineering. 

--> see bayesian_report for more information

--> see Model.ipynb for the STAN implementation of the model

--> see cluster_computation.R for the R script which fixes the clustering using SALSO package (Binder loss, VI loss) starting from draws of the cluster allocation vector 

--> see Model_fixed_clusters.ipnyb for the STAN implementation of the model with fixed clustering

--> see CARModel standardized data.R for running the model CarBayes.ST (model comparison chapter of the report)
