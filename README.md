Github repository of the project: "Bayesian modeling and clustering for spatio-temporal areal data: An application to Italian Fertility Rate".
This is a group project for the Bayesian Statistics course held in the year 2022-2023 at the Politecnico di Milano for the master degree course in Mathematical Engineering. 

--> see bayesian_report for more information

--> see Model.ipynb for the STAN implementation of the model

--> see cluster_computation.R for fixing the clustering using SALSO package (BInder loss, VI loss) starting from draws of the cluster allocation vector s

--> see Model_fixed_clusters.ipnyb for the STAN implementation of the model with fixed clustering

--> see CARModel standardized data.R for the running the model CarBayes (model comparison chapter of the report)
